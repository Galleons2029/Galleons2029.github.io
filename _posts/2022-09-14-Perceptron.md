This is a sample blog post. Lorem ipsum I can't remember the rest of lorem ipsum and don't have an internet connection right now. Testing testing testing this blog post. Blog posts are cool.

1. **Perceptron Algorithm**
   - Input: \( \left\{ \left( x^{(i)}, y^{(i)} \right), i=1, \ldots, n \right\}, T \)
   - Initialize \( \theta = 0 \) (vector)

2. For each \( t = 1, \ldots, T \)
   1. For each \( i = 1, \ldots, n \)
      - If \( y^{(i)} \left( \theta \cdot x^{(i)} \right) \leq 0 \)
         - Update: \( \theta = \theta + y^{(i)} x^{(i)} \)
